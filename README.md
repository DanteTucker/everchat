## About
I made this chat thing as a personal project mostly for myself.
Right now it's features include

 - Contacts list that behaves the same as in game.
 - Send Text messages.
 -  Receive text, voice messages and Invites.
 - Set your status, online or invisible.

Some notes:

 - You log on as invisible by default, set yourself online in the Status menu.
 - Voice messages received before migration don't work.
## Get it
You can find a pre compiled version in the Release tab near the top of this page.

## Compiling

 1. Use NuGet to add Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Common
 2. Add a reference to Durian_Data\Managed\SkyFrost.Base.dll
 
 If you like, VS's Publish feature can compile it down to a single exe.
